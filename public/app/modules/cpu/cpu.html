<!-- Template which gets loaded when the http://127.0.0.1/#/cpu route is called -->
<!-- With ng-controller we declaring the controller to which this view gets bind -->
<div id='cpu' class='container content_container' role='main' ng-controller='CpuCtrl'>

    <!-- Using a panel from the Bootstrap framework to get a responsive panel element -->
    <div class='panel panel-default'>
        <!-- Heading of the panel -->
        <div class='panel-heading'>
            <!-- Using a customized directive.

                 Because we declared the CpuCtrl as the controller we get the
                 scope variable $scope.state from this controller injected into 
                 the directive. The directive is using the scope variable and
                 renders it's template into this DOM element.

                 We could also directly access the scope variable in this template
                 with the following annotation: {{state}} -->
            <h3 class='panel-title'>
                <cpu-info></cpu-info>
            </h3>
        </div>
        <!-- Body of the panel in which we want to show the graph with the current
             cpu utilization.
             Note that we created our directives with the restrict opition 'E' 
             therefore angular only recognizes our directive when it's called 
             like an element. -->
        <div class='panel-body'>
            <!-- Setting the renderer and color attributes.
                 In this case we want to draw a red area graph. -->
            <cpu-graph renderer='area' color='#ff0000'></cpu-graph>
